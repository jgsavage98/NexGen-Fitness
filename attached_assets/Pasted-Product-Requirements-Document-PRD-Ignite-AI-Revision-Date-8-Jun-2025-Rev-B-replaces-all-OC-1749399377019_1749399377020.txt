Product Requirements Document (PRD) – Ignite-AI

Revision Date: 8 Jun 2025 (Rev B — replaces all “OCR” references with OpenAI Vision extraction)

1 Purpose & Vision

Ignite-AI delivers premium-level nutrition and workout coaching through a single mobile app. Clients upload a daily screenshot of their MyFitnessPal® Nutrition dashboard; an OpenAI Vision model extracts macro totals, an OpenAI GPT-4o prompt engine proposes macro changes, and Coach Chassidy approves or edits every change before it reaches the client.

Only the “Virtual Agent” chat is explicitly branded as AI. All nutrition and training decisions appear to come directly from Coach Chassidy, preserving a human-led feel while automating data entry, calculations, and reminders.
