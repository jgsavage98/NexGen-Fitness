Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Project Code-name: Ignite-AI
Prepared for: John Savage (CTO / Head of Product) & Chassidy Escobedo (CXO)
Revision Date: 7 Jun 2025

1. Purpose & Vision

Build a mobile-first, AI-powered fitness-and-nutrition coaching app that replaces Mind Strong’s 1-on-1 model with:

24 / 7 GPT-4o chat & voice Coach-Brain
Adaptive macro targets and workouts driven by real-time data
Embedded 1 000-exercise library (looping demos + anatomy overlays)
Light human oversight (Chassidy) for safety & motivational touchpoints
North-star: Deliver 90 %+ of a premium coaching outcome at < 40 % of the cost, while remaining unmistakably “our own brand”—not a Mind Strong clone.
2. Problem Statement

Mind Strong’s $2 500 / 12-week program is effective but:

Scales linearly with coach payroll
Replies can lag up to 24 h
Users toggle across multiple tools (Voxer, Kajabi, MyFitnessPal)
Ignite-AI removes those friction points with always-on AI, unified UX, and near-zero incremental cost.

3. Goals & Success Metrics

Goal	KPI	Target at 6 mo post-launch
Drive engagement	Daily Active / Monthly Active (DAU / MAU)	≥ 35 %
Demonstrate personalization wins	Avg. macro-adherence improvement (baseline → week 12)	+20 %
Retain users	Cohort LTV / CAC	≥ 4 ×
Unit economics	Gross margin	≥ 95 %
Safety	Content-safety escalations resolved < 2 h	100 %
4. Personas

Persona	Archetype	Pain points	What Ignite-AI solves
Self-starter Sam	30 yr, tech-savvy, wants data-driven plan	Sick of Googling “best macros”	Instant macro engine, 24 / 7 chat
Busy-parent Priya	41 yr, minimal workout time	Needs guidance without scheduling Zoom calls	Chat + push nudges on her schedule
Returning athlete Alex	29 yr, rehabbing back injury	Needs exercise swaps	Built-in regression / progression toggles
Corporate wellness lead Casey	Buys licenses for employees	Needs scalable coaching at low cost	Near-zero marginal user cost
5. High-Level User Stories (MVP)

Onboarding
As a new user I answer a short intake (gender, goals, injuries, height, weight) so my plan starts personalized.
Macro Tracking
As a user I sync meals from MyFitnessPal so the AI coach can adjust my daily macro targets.
Workout Execution
As a user I see today’s workout with demo video and can swap an exercise if it bothers my back.
Chat & Voice
As a user I press a mic button, ask a question, and get an instant AI answer (or human follow-up if complex).
Weekly Progress
As a user I get a Monday report card (KPIs, suggestions) without having to email anyone.
6. Functional Requirements

Module	Requirement ID	Description
Onboarding	ONB-01	5-step wizard (gender, goal, injuries, metrics, account) must complete in ≤ 90 s.
ONB-02	Must support Imperial & Metric toggles.
Macro Engine	MAC-01	Daily cron scores calories, protein, carbs, fat; adjusts targets ±5 % per adherence rule set.
MAC-02	Chassidy can edit rule coefficients via admin panel.
Workout Engine	WKT-01	GET /workout/today returns JSON array of exercises w/ regressionId & progressionId.
WKT-02	Swapping an exercise logs event exerciseSwap with reason.
Coach-Brain (Chat)	CH-01	GPT-4o system prompt must inject “Chassidy coaching tone guidelines v1.0”.
CH-02	Low-confidence (< 0.7) replies routed to /queue/moderation with 2-hour SLA.
Media	MED-01	Exercise demo must stream MP4 < 4 MB; fallback WebP < 2 MB.
MED-02	Anatomy PNG overlay supports primary (red) vs. secondary (amber) highlight.
Notifications	NOT-01	Push reminders at 08:00 local + adaptive nudge if no meal logged by 13:00.
Analytics	ANA-01	Track DAU, macro adherence, workout completion; send to App Insights.
7. Non-Functional Requirements
