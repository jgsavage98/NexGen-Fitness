# NexGen Fitness - Local Setup Instructions

## Repository Issue Resolution

Since the GitHub repository appears empty, here's how to get your complete codebase locally:

### Option 1: Download Project Files from Replit

1. **Download from Replit**: 
   - In your Replit workspace, click the three dots menu (â‹¯) next to your project name
   - Select "Download as ZIP"
   - Extract the ZIP file on your Mac

2. **Create Local Git Repository**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to extracted folder
   cd NexGen-Fitness
   
   # Initialize git and add remote
   git init
   git remote add origin https://github.com/jgsavage98/NexGen-Fitness.git
   
   # Add all files and push
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Complete fitness coaching app"
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 2: Push from Replit Git Interface

1. Go to your Replit Git tab
2. Make sure all files are staged (green checkmarks)
3. Click "Commit & Push" to push to GitHub
4. Then clone normally: `git clone https://github.com/jgsavage98/NexGen-Fitness.git`

## iOS Mobile App Setup (After Getting Code Locally)

### Prerequisites
- Mac computer (required for iOS development)
- Xcode from Mac App Store (free, ~10GB)
- Node.js 18+ (check with `node --version`)

### Setup Steps

1. **Install Development Tools**:
   ```bash
   # Install Xcode command line tools
   xcode-select --install
   
   # Install CocoaPods (if not already installed)
   sudo gem install cocoapods
   ```

2. **Install Project Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to your project
   cd NexGen-Fitness
   
   # Install main project dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Navigate to mobile folder and install mobile dependencies
   cd mobile
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   
   # Install iOS dependencies
   cd ios
   pod install
   cd ..
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:

   **Terminal 1 - Backend Server:**
   ```bash
   # From project root (NexGen-Fitness/)
   npm run dev
   ```

   **Terminal 2 - Mobile Metro Bundler:**
   ```bash
   # From mobile folder (NexGen-Fitness/mobile/)
   npm start
   ```

   **Terminal 3 - iOS Simulator:**
   ```bash
   # From mobile folder (NexGen-Fitness/mobile/)
   npm run ios
   ```
