# Mobile Setup - Alternative Approaches

## Issue: Tunnel Mode Failed
The ngrok tunnel installation failed. Here are working alternatives:

## Option 1: Try Local Network Again (Recommended)
Since your IP is confirmed correct, try the local connection with a few fixes:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/Personal/NexGen-Fitness/TestAppExpo
npx expo start --lan
```

This forces LAN mode instead of tunnel mode.

## Option 2: Manual ngrok Installation
```bash
# Install ngrok manually
brew install ngrok

# Then try tunnel mode again
npx expo start --tunnel
```

## Option 3: Use Expo Development Build
```bash
cd ~/Documents/Personal/NexGen-Fitness/TestAppExpo
npx expo start --dev-client
```

## Option 4: Expo Go Web Preview (Test Only)
```bash
npx expo start --web
```

This opens in your Mac browser to test the app interface.

## Option 5: Use Different Port
Try a different port if 8081 is blocked:

```bash
npx expo start --port 8082
```

## Most Likely Fix: LAN Mode
Try Option 1 first (`--lan` instead of `--tunnel`). This often works when tunnel mode fails.
