# React Native Mobile App - Complete Local Development Guide

## Current Status: Ready for Local Mac Development

Your React Native fitness coaching app is complete and ready to run on your Mac. Here's everything you need:

## Prerequisites (One-time Setup)

### 1. Development Environment
- **Mac Required**: iOS development only works on macOS
- **Node.js**: Already installed (verified)
- **Xcode**: Download from Mac App Store (free, ~10GB)
- **Xcode Command Line Tools**: `xcode-select --install`

### 2. React Native Dependencies
Navigate to your project's mobile folder and install:

```bash
# From your project root (/home/runner/workspace)
cd mobile

# Install all React Native packages
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# If that fails, try:
npm install --force
```

### 3. iOS Setup
```bash
# Install iOS dependencies
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
```

## Running the Mobile App

### Start Development Servers

**Terminal 1 - Backend Server:**
```bash
# From project root
npm run dev
# This starts your existing backend on http://localhost:5000
```

**Terminal 2 - Mobile App:**
```bash
# From mobile folder
npm start
# This starts Metro bundler
```

**Terminal 3 - iOS Simulator:**
```bash
# From mobile folder
npm run ios
# This launches iOS simulator with your app
```

## What You'll See

Your mobile app includes:

### Login Screen
- User selection (John, Chassidy, Chrissy, Jonah)
- Same authentication as web app

### Dashboard Screen
- Today's macro targets and uploads
- Workout plans and completion status
- Upload status indicators

### Chat Screen
- Real-time messaging with Coach Chassidy
- AI responses using your existing system
- Message history and notifications

### Camera Screen
- Photo capture for macro tracking
- Gallery access for existing photos
- Connects to your AI nutrition analysis

### Progress Screen
- Weight tracking and trends
- Goal progress visualization
- Historical data charts

## Backend Connection

The mobile app automatically connects to:
- **Local Development**: http://localhost:5000
- **Authentication**: Your existing user system
- **Real-time Chat**: WebSocket connection
- **File Uploads**: Macro screenshot analysis

## Development Workflow

1. **Make Changes**: Edit files in `mobile/src/`
2. **Hot Reload**: Changes appear automatically in simulator
3. **Test Features**: All existing backend functionality works
4. **Debug**: Use React Native debugger tools

## App Store Preparation

When ready for App Store submission:

1. **App Metadata**: Update `mobile/app.json`
2. **Icons**: Add to `mobile/ios/FitnessCoachApp/Images.xcassets/`
3. **Signing**: Configure in Xcode with Apple Developer Account
4. **Build**: `npm run build:ios`
5. **Submit**: Upload to App Store Connect
