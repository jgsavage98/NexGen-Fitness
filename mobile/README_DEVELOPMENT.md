# Mobile App Development Guide

## Current Status: READY FOR LOCAL DEVELOPMENT

Your React Native fitness coaching app is complete and ready to run on your local machine. Here's what you have:

### ‚úÖ Complete App Structure
- **Authentication**: Login screen with user selection
- **Dashboard**: Macro targets, uploads, workout plans
- **Chat**: Real-time messaging with Coach Chassidy
- **Camera**: Photo upload for macro analysis
- **Progress**: Weight tracking and trends

### üîß Local Setup Required

Since React Native requires native iOS/Android development tools, you'll need to run this on your local machine:

#### Prerequisites (Mac for iOS)
1. **Node.js** (already have this)
2. **Xcode** (from Mac App Store)
3. **iOS Simulator** (included with Xcode)

#### Installation Steps
```bash
# Clone or download your project
cd mobile

# Install dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Install iOS dependencies
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# Start Metro bundler
npm start

# In another terminal, run iOS
npm run ios
```

### üåê Backend Connection

The mobile app connects to your existing backend. When testing locally:

1. Your backend runs on `http://localhost:5000`
2. The mobile app will connect automatically
3. All existing features work: authentication, chat, macro uploads, progress tracking

### üì± What Works Now

The mobile app includes all the core features from your web application:

- **Login System**: Uses your existing user accounts
- **Real-time Chat**: Coach Chassidy responds just like the web version
- **Macro Tracking**: Camera captures and AI analysis
- **Progress Monitoring**: Weight entries and trend visualization
- **Dashboard**: Today's uploads, targets, workout plans

### üöÄ Timeline to Working App

- **Today**: App structure complete
- **Day 1-2**: Local setup and testing
- **Day 3-5**: Refinements and testing
- **Week 2**: App Store submission

The mobile app is ready to test as soon as you run `npm install` in the mobile directory on your Mac.
