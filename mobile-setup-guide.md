## Issue Diagnosed
- Metro bundler connectivity issues in current environment
- Both iOS simulator and iPhone Expo Go app failing with same network error
- Port 8081 is accessible but Metro bundler isn't serving properly

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Web-Based Mobile View (Immediate Solution)
Create a mobile-responsive web version that provides the same experience:

```bash
# Add mobile view to existing web app
# Navigate to web app in Safari on iPhone
# Add to Home Screen for native-like experience
```

### Option 2: Expo Web (Alternative)
Use Expo's web capabilities to create a Progressive Web App:

```bash
# In your Expo project
npx expo install react-native-web react-dom
npx expo start --web
```

### Option 3: Local Development Environment
If you need true native development, consider:

```bash
# On your local Mac (not Replit)
git clone https://github.com/jgsavage98/NexGen-Fitness
cd NexGen-Fitness
npm install
npx create-expo-app@latest NexGenFitnessMobile
# Copy mobile code and continue development locally
```
